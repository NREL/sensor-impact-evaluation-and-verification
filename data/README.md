# sensor_impact_FDD: Raw Data Preparation

This module is developed based on the fault building simulation data that calibrated on Oak Ridge National Laboratory's Flexible Research Platform.
The data include 22 fault types data under seven weathers from different climate zones. The details of physics-based modeling of the faulty buildings are introduced in [this paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-5309/9/11/233/htm).

Downloading data is mandatory to use the classes in the repo,

The data can be downloaded [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). Please contact Liang.Zhang@nrel.gov if there is any download issues.

Unzip the downloaded data and copy-paste them under this folder.
